## Style Guide (mostly following the Google Java style guide)
* 100 characters a line maximum
* On line breaks that involve operators, break BEFORE the operator
( + object.x will go on the next line)
* Comments belong above whatever block of code they refer to
* Comments belong at the same indentation level as whatever block of code they refer to
* A new line after Constructor and Function definitions
